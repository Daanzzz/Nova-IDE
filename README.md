# Nova IDE

Nova is an IDE that allows users to connect to each other in a P2P connection, which is then used in order to synchronize file changes in the project that the users are currently working on.

Some additional info:

- The server is written mostly in C++, while using SQLite to create a user database and also python for a short script.
- The client is written in C#, WPF is used for the GUI.

# ðŸ“„ Note

This is the latest version of my self made IDE, it is quite stable but still requires some changes that won't necessarily be made.
